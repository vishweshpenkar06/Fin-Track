# Reticle

Start by detecting which mode to run:

```bash
# Is Reticle already set up in this project?
cat .reticle.json 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

- **`.reticle.json` not found → run Setup (below)**
- **`.reticle.json` found → run Test (further below)**

---

# SETUP MODE

> Run this once per project. Writes config files, installs the SDK, and validates the connection. After setup, every subsequent `/reticle` goes straight to Test mode.

## Step 0 — Ask these questions before doing anything

Ask ALL of them in a single message. Do not start installing until you have the answers.

**Before asking Q5**, run the detection commands below to pre-fill a suggestion — but always confirm with the user, because they may plan to use a tool that isn't installed yet.

```bash
which claude    2>/dev/null && echo "claude-code"
which opencode  2>/dev/null && echo "opencode"
which codex     2>/dev/null && echo "codex"
ls ~/.cursor/                             2>/dev/null && echo "cursor"
ls ~/.codeium/windsurf/                   2>/dev/null && echo "windsurf"
ls .vscode/                               2>/dev/null && echo "vscode"
which zed       2>/dev/null && echo "zed"
```

```
1. What framework/stack is this app?
   a) Vite + React (specify React 18 or 19)
   b) Next.js (specify version + app/pages router)
   c) Vite + Vue
   d) Vite + Svelte
   e) SvelteKit
   f) Remix
   g) Plain HTML / vanilla JS / other

2. What package manager are you using?
   npm | pnpm | yarn | bun

3. What port does your dev server run on?
   (e.g. 3000, 5173, 8080 — the port number only, not the full URL)
   Reticle attaches to your running server — you keep running `npm run dev` yourself.
   Reticle does NOT start or manage your dev server.

4. Do you already have data-testid attributes on your key elements?
   (If yes, Reticle reuses them. If no, we'll add a handful to the most important elements.)

5. Which AI coding tool(s) will you use this project with?
   (I detected: <list from detection above, or "none found">)

   a) Claude Code   b) OpenCode   c) Codex CLI
   d) Cursor        e) Windsurf   f) VS Code + GitHub Copilot   g) Zed
   h) Multiple — list them

   Save as RETICLE_HARNESSES.
```

## Step 1 — Configure the MCP server

> **Fast path (Claude Code + Vite or Next.js):** Run `npx @reticlehq/server init --port <Q3 answer>`. This handles Steps 1–4 automatically for Claude Code and Cursor. Jump to Step 4 to validate.

> For all other harnesses or manual control, follow the steps below. There is no single MCP config file all tools share. Each harness has its own file and schema. Write only the ones in `RETICLE_HARNESSES`.

| Tool | File | Root key | Command format | `type` needed? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/claude_mcp_config.json` | `mcpServers` | `"command"` + `"args"` split | no |
| OpenCode | `opencode.json` | `mcp` | `"command"` flat array | `"local"` required |
| Codex CLI | `.codex/config.toml` | `[mcp_servers.reticle]` | TOML `command` + `args` | no |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | `mcpServers` | `"command"` + `"args"` split | no |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | `mcpServers` | `"command"` + `"args"` split | no |
| VS Code | `.vscode/mcp.json` | `"servers"` | `"command"` + `"args"` split | no |
| Zed | `~/.config/zed/settings.json` | `context_servers` | `"command"` + `"args"` split | no |

**Claude Code** (user-level, default)

Register once globally so Reticle is available in every project:

```bash
claude mcp add reticle -s user -- npx @reticlehq/server mcp
```

Confirm with `claude mcp list` — `reticle` should appear. **After adding, restart Claude Code** (or run `/mcp` to refresh) so it picks up the server.

**If the `claude` CLI is unavailable**, fall back to writing `~/.claude/claude_mcp_config.json` (create if missing, merge `"reticle"` if it exists):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reticle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@reticlehq/server", "mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

Only write to `.mcp.json` (project root) if the user explicitly asks for project-level registration.

**OpenCode — `opencode.json`** (`type:"local"` required; command is one flat array, no `args`)

```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "reticle": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "@reticlehq/server", "mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

Verify with `opencode mcp list`.

**Codex CLI — `.codex/config.toml`** (TOML, not JSON)

```toml
[mcp_servers.reticle]
command = "npx"
args    = ["@reticlehq/server", "mcp"]
```

**Cursor — `.cursor/mcp.json`** (same schema as Claude Code, different path)

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reticle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@reticlehq/server", "mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

**Windsurf — `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`** (global; create if missing)

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reticle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@reticlehq/server", "mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

**VS Code — `.vscode/mcp.json`** (`"servers"` not `"mcpServers"` — most common mistake)

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "reticle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@reticlehq/server", "mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

MCP tools only appear in Copilot **Agent mode**.

**Zed — `~/.config/zed/settings.json`** (`context_servers` not `mcpServers`)

```jsonc
{
  "context_servers": {
    "reticle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@reticlehq/server", "mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

---

## Step 1b — Stop hook (Claude Code only — skip unless asked)

**Do not add this hook by default.** Killing the daemon after every turn is the most common cause of the "Failed to reconnect to reticle: -32000" error: the daemon is stopped, Claude Code immediately reconnects, and the new daemon sometimes takes longer than expected to boot — the proxy times out and exits with code 1, which Claude Code reports as -32000.

Reticle doesn't need the hook. `reticle_yield` (mandatory — see Rules) signals turn end in-band, and the server flips the panel to "waiting" automatically if the agent goes quiet.

Only add this if the user explicitly asks for the daemon to stop between turns:

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "npx @reticlehq/server stop --quiet" }],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

---

## Step 2 — Install the SDK

> **Mental model:** The user keeps running their dev server (`npm run dev`) themselves. Reticle embeds a tiny SDK in the app that connects to a local bridge daemon. The agent talks to the daemon over MCP — no Chromium is downloaded or needed for standard agent workflows. Playwright is only required if you explicitly use `--drive` mode.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @reticlehq/react @reticlehq/vite-plugin    # swap npm for pnpm/yarn/bun per Q2
# Next.js instead of Vite? npm install --save-dev @reticlehq/react @reticlehq/next
```

---

## Step 3 — Wire up the SDK

**Vite + React**

Add the Reticle plugin to `vite.config.ts` — it auto-injects `reticle.connect()` in dev builds:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { reticle } from '@reticlehq/vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), reticle()], // reticle() is dev-only, dropped from vite build
});
```

Then describe your app's testable surface so the agent knows what to drive (fill in your real values):

```ts
// src/reticle-dev.ts — self-guards on import.meta.env.DEV, so it's a no-op in prod
import { registerCapabilities } from '@reticlehq/react';
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  registerCapabilities({
    testids: [], // your data-testid values, e.g. ['login-btn', 'submit-form']
    signals: [], // your reticle.signal() names, e.g. ['auth:login']
    stores: [], // your registerStore() names
  });
}
```

Then load it once from your entry file — add this line near the top of `src/main.tsx` (the dynamic `import()` keeps it out of the production bundle):

```ts
// src/main.tsx
if (import.meta.env.DEV) import('./reticle-dev');
```

To emit `reticle.signal()` from app code (components, stores), **never import `reticle` statically** — a top-level `import { reticle } from '@reticlehq/react'` drags the whole dev-only SDK into your production bundle. Funnel signals through a dev-guarded helper so `import.meta.env.DEV` dead-code-eliminates it in prod:

```ts
// src/reticle.ts — import { signal } from './reticle' in your components
export function signal(name: string, data?: Record<string, unknown>): void {
  if (!import.meta.env.DEV) return;
  void import('@reticlehq/react').then(({ reticle }) => reticle.signal(name, data));
}
```

**Next.js (App Router)**

Create `app/reticle-dev.tsx`:

```ts
'use client';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
export function ReticleDev() {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development') return;
    void import('@reticlehq/react').then(({ reticle, install, registerCapabilities }) => {
      install();
      // The bridge requires a pairing token. Vite users get it auto-injected; hand-wired Next passes it
      // in: set RETICLE_TOKEN for the daemon and expose the same value as NEXT_PUBLIC_RETICLE_TOKEN.
      const token = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RETICLE_TOKEN;
      reticle.connect(token ? { token } : {});
      registerCapabilities({
        testids: [], // your data-testid values
        signals: [], // your reticle.signal() names
        stores: [], // your registerStore() names
      });
    });
  }, []);
  return null;
}
```

Mount it in `app/layout.tsx` (dev-only):

```tsx
import { ReticleDev } from './reticle-dev';
// inside <body>:
{
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? <ReticleDev /> : null;
}
```

Add `@reticlehq/next` → `withReticle` to `next.config.mjs` for source mapping:

```ts
import { withReticle } from '@reticlehq/next';
export default withReticle(nextConfig);
```

**Other frameworks** — call `reticle.connect()` and `install()` inside a dev guard. Vanilla / HTML: use a dynamic `import('@reticlehq/react')` inside `if (location.hostname === 'localhost')`.

---

## Step 4 — Save config and validate

If you used `reticle init` in Step 1, `.reticle.json` was already written. Verify with:

```bash
cat .reticle.json
```

If setting up manually, write `.reticle.json` to the project root (commit this — `reticle mcp` reads it to pick the right port):

```jsonc
{
  "framework": "vite-react",
}
```

Fill in `framework` from Q1. **Leave `port` out** — it defaults to `4400` and everything just works for a single app.

> **`port` here is the Reticle _bridge_ port — NOT your dev server port.** The bridge is the daemon ↔ SDK channel (default `4400`); your dev server (Q3, e.g. 5173) is a separate thing Reticle never touches. Do **not** set `.reticle.json` `port` to your dev-server port — that collides the daemon with your app.
>
> Only set `port` when running **multiple apps at once**, so each gets its own bridge. When you do, set the **same** value in two places or the SDK and daemon never meet:
>
> ```jsonc
> // .reticle.json          →  reticle({ port: 4460 })  in vite.config.ts
> { "framework": "vite-react", "port": 4460 }
> ```
>
> Pick any free port that is **not** your dev-server port (4460, 4461, …).

Tell the user: **"Run `npm run dev` (your normal dev server) and open the app in your browser."**

Once they confirm the app is open, call `reticle_run({ tool: "reticle_wait_ready" })` (or poll `reticle_sessions()`), then `reticle_sessions()`. You should see a session whose URL matches the app's localhost address.

### No session appeared? Work this checklist in order

Most no-connect cases are one of these. Fastest signal first:

1. **Read the browser console.** The SDK announces its own failures. If you see `[Reticle] could not reach the bridge at ws://localhost:<port> … Is the Reticle daemon running on that port?` — that's a **port mismatch or a dead daemon** (items 2–3), and the message tells you which port the app is dialing. No `[Reticle]` line at all → the SDK never loaded (item 4).
2. **Port match (the #1 manual-setup bug).** The app's bridge port MUST equal the daemon's. Check both:
   - App side: `reticle({ port: N })` in `vite.config.ts` (or `connect({ url: 'ws://localhost:N/reticle' })`) — omitted ⇒ `4400`.
   - Daemon side: `.reticle.json` `"port"` / `RETICLE_PORT` — omitted ⇒ `4400`. They must be the **same number**, and it must **not** be your dev-server port. Simplest fix: remove the port from both and let them default to `4400`.
3. **Is the daemon up on that port?** `npx @reticlehq/server status` lists running daemons + connected sessions. Nothing there ⇒ the agent hasn't launched it yet (restart the agent / `/mcp`), or it's on a different port than the app (item 2).
4. **Is the SDK actually wired + loaded in dev?** `reticle()` present in `vite.config.ts`; for the manual entry, `if (import.meta.env.DEV) import('./reticle-dev')` in `src/main.tsx`. After editing `vite.config.ts` you **must restart `vite`** (config changes need a fresh dev server), then **hard-reload the browser tab**. A production build won't connect — the SDK is dev-only by design.
5. **Still nothing?** See the full [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section (stale `npx` cache, Stop-hook killing the daemon, `-32000`).

When a session is confirmed, tell the user:

> "Reticle is set up. Type `/reticle` anytime to verify the app after a change."

**Setup complete — stop here. Do not proceed to Test mode.**

---

---

# TEST MODE

> Runs automatically when `.reticle.json` exists. Connects to the running app, exercises flows, asserts outcomes, and reports what passed and what broke.

## Phase 1 — Connect

Just ran `reticle init` or started the dev server? Block until the app's SDK connects first, so your first real call doesn't lose the race with the WebSocket — call **`reticle_run({ tool: "reticle_wait_ready" })`** (in the default `hybrid` profile `reticle_wait_ready` isn't advertised directly; reach it via `reticle_run`), or just poll **`reticle_sessions()`** until your tab appears. Then, with `reticle_sessions()`, there are three possible states:

**A. One session → proceed.**

**B. No sessions:** Tell the user:

> "No app connected. Run your dev server (`npm run dev`) and open the app in your browser, then try `/reticle` again. Reticle never starts the dev server for you — that's your job." Stop here.

**C. Multiple sessions — ask:**

> "I see [N] sessions connected: [list sessionId + url]. Which should I test?"

Pin `sessionId` for every subsequent call.

---

## Phase 2 — Orient

Call these in parallel:

```
reticle_snapshot({ sessionId, maxDepth: 3 })
reticle_run({ tool: "reticle_capabilities", args: { sessionId } })   // not advertised in the default hybrid profile — reach it via reticle_run
reticle_network({ sessionId, limit: 10 })
reticle_console({ sessionId, limit: 20 })
```

> **Default `hybrid` profile:** only the ~14 core verify tools are advertised directly. Anything else the skill names — `reticle_wait_ready`, `reticle_capabilities`, `reticle_yield`, `reticle_review`, `reticle_inspect`, the flow/record tools — is reached with `reticle_run({ tool, args })` (or list params first with `reticle_tools`). To advertise them all directly instead, set `RETICLE_TOOL_PROFILE=standard` (flows + extras) or `=full` (everything).

Build a mental model:

- **Route/screen:** where is the app right now?
- **Testids:** what interactive elements are registered?
- **Signals:** what domain events does the app emit?
- **Console state:** any errors already present before touching anything?

Pre-existing console errors → call them out immediately before testing.

---

## Phase 3 — Decide what to test

Check what changed: `git diff HEAD --stat 2>/dev/null | head -20`

Then pick a mode:

| Context                                    | Mode                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| User says "test X" or names a flow         | **Targeted** — focus on that feature             |
| User says "everything" or "smoke test"     | **Smoke** — exercise every registered testid     |
| Recent git diff shows a specific component | **Targeted** — that component and adjacent flows |
| No clear signal                            | **Smoke**                                        |

---

## Phase 4 — Run the tests

### Targeted

1. Navigate if needed: `reticle_navigate({ sessionId, url })`
2. Snapshot to confirm correct state
3. Act on controls using testids:
   ```
   reticle_act({ sessionId, ref, action: "click" })
   ```
4. Assert — always use `since` from the act result:
   ```
   reticle_assert({ sessionId, since, timeout_ms: 5000, predicate: { kind: "allOf", predicates: [
     { kind: "net",     method: "POST", urlContains: "/api/...", status: 200 },
     { kind: "element", query: { role: "...", name: "..." }, state: "visible" },
     { kind: "signal",  name: "..." },
     { kind: "console", level: "error", absent: true }
   ]}})
   ```
5. Record: ✅ pass / ❌ fail / ⚠️ partial

### Smoke

Walk every testid in `capabilities.testids`. For each one that is visible and interactable:

```
reticle_query({ sessionId, by: "testid", value: testid })
→ reticle_act({ sessionId, ref, action: "click" })
→ reticle_assert({ since, predicate: { kind: "console", level: "error", absent: true } })
```

Flag anything that throws a console error or triggers a `status >= 400` network call.

### Regression suite (record once, re-verify on every change)

For flows worth re-checking forever — the actual test suite — record them, then re-verify the whole set in ONE deterministic call (no LLM per flow, so it's ~hundreds of tokens, not a full re-drive):

1. Record + assert the business outcome (not just clicks):
   ```
   reticle_record_start({ recordingName: "ship-deploy" })
   → drive the flow with reticle_act
   → reticle_annotate({ flow: "ship-deploy", kind: "intent", text: "ship a deploy to production" })
   → reticle_annotate({ flow: "ship-deploy", kind: "success-state", signal: "deploy:shipped" })
   → reticle_record_stop({ recordingName: "ship-deploy" }) → reticle_flow_save({ flowName: "ship-deploy" })
   ```
2. After any change, re-verify EVERY saved flow at once:

   ```
   reticle_flow_verify({ sessionId })
   → { status: "pass"|"fail", passed, failed, failures: [{ flow, verdict, whatChanged, whereInSource, nextAction }] }
   ```

   On a failure the envelope tells you exactly what changed, the `file:line`, and the fix (e.g. "rebind to 'new-deploy'") — act on `nextAction` directly. A single flow: `reticle_flow_replay({ flowName })`.

   > **Tool profile (default `hybrid`).** Reticle advertises the ~12 core verify tools directly and keeps everything else (record/replay/verify/heal, screenshots, network-mock, …) one call away behind two meta-tools — to save ~64% of per-turn tool-schema tokens. Reach a non-core tool with `reticle_run({ tool: "reticle_flow_verify", args: { sessionId } })`, or `reticle_tools` first to list/learn params. Prefer them advertised directly (no `reticle_run`)? Set `RETICLE_TOOL_PROFILE=standard` (flows + extras direct) or `=full` (all tools).

### Read program truth in one call — instead of reconstructing it from the DOM

Reticle's edge over a DOM/screenshot tool is **efficiency and robustness**, not that it sees things nothing else can. A capable browser-automation agent _can_ reach app state by running JS in the page (e.g. walking the React fiber via `browser_evaluate`) — but that's fragile (breaks on minified prod builds, non-React stores, framework-internals changes) and costs ~10× the tool-calls/tokens/time. Reticle reads the same truth with **one typed call**, stably:

- **UI-vs-state desync** (the UI shows one value, the store holds another — e.g. a count that didn't refresh, or a value corrupted in the store but rendered in no view): `reticle_state({ sessionId, store, path })` returns it directly. A pure snapshot can't see it; an agent spelunking framework internals can, but at far higher cost — measured head-to-head, Reticle-MCP caught a never-rendered store tamper in **4 tool calls / 45s** where a Playwright-MCP agent needed **45 calls / ~9min** reverse-engineering the React fiber.
- **Present-but-unusable / off-theme controls**: `reticle_inspect` returns `occluded` (covered by an overlay), `styles.cursor`/`opacity`, `box` (0×0), and `theme.offTheme` (color off the design-token palette) — the "is it actually usable / on-brand?" read, in one call.

### Consume the human's bug reports (`reticle_review`)

The dev can click **"Flag a bug"** in the running app, point at an element, and type what's wrong. Each flag becomes a **mark** you drain with `reticle_review`:

```
reticle_review({ sessionId })
→ { marks: [{ id: "m1", note: "this button is misaligned", label: "button \"Pay\"",
              source: { file: "src/Checkout.tsx", line: 42 },
              fix: "Open src/Checkout.tsx:42 and fix: this button is misaligned. Then reticle_review { resolve: \"m1\" }" }],
    pendingCount: 1 }
```

Check it at the start of a session and whenever the human may have flagged something. Open the `source` file:line, apply the fix the `note` asks for, verify, then `reticle_review({ resolve: "m1" })`. Reading never consumes a mark, so you can list → fix → verify → resolve.

---

## Phase 5 — Report

Always refer to the tool as **Reticle** in reports, summaries, and messages to the user.

```
## Reticle — <route or feature>

**Result: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL / ⚠️ PARTIAL**

| Flow | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Login → dashboard | ✅ | POST /api/login 200, route /dashboard |
| Click "Deploy"    | ❌ | POST /api/deploy 401 — missing auth header |
| Sidebar nav       | ✅ | 4 items, no console errors |

**Console errors:** none / <list>
**Failed requests:** none / <list>
**Fix at:** src/lib/api.ts:65   ← from reticle_inspect on the failing element
```

If something failed, call `reticle_inspect({ sessionId, ref })` on the failing element to get the `file:line`, and include it in the report.

---

## Rules (always apply in Test mode)

- **Always close the session when you stop driving.** The human may be watching the browser, so the panel must reflect your real state — never leave it reading "live" when you've stopped. The moment you finish a turn or need the human, call `reticle_yield({ mode: "waiting" })`, or `reticle_yield({ mode: "ask", note: "<your question>" })` when you're blocked on them. Call `reticle_end_session()` only when the whole task is done. The session revives automatically on your next action, so this is cheap and safe to do every time. (A server-side idle fallback flips the panel to "waiting" if you forget, but signal it yourself — it's immediate and it can say _why_.)
- Always pass `since` in `reticle_assert` — scopes to post-action events, prevents stale buffer fakes.
- Always assert `{ kind: "console", level: "error", absent: true }` — silent errors are the most common thing agents miss.
- Batch net + element + signal + console into one `allOf` — don't call `reticle_assert` four times.
- Never assert on pixels — use predicates, not `reticle_screenshot` (screenshots are for genuinely visual checks only).
- If the session disconnects mid-test (navigation creates a new session ID) — call `reticle_sessions()` again and continue.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Multiple projects / port conflicts

Each project should have its own port in `.reticle.json`. When `reticle mcp` starts, it reads `.reticle.json` in the current working directory and uses that project's port — so agents in different project directories automatically connect to different daemons.

If two projects share the same port, start the second on a different port:

```bash
npx @reticlehq/server stop --port 4400   # stop the other project's daemon if needed
# Then ensure .reticle.json in this project has a unique "port" field
```

Use `npx @reticlehq/server status` to see which daemons are running and which sessions are connected.

### No Chromium / Playwright needed for standard use

Reticle does NOT download Chromium for normal agent workflows. The browser SDK runs inside the user's own browser — the agent sees the DOM, network, console, and state through the WebSocket bridge. Playwright is only installed if you explicitly call `reticle serve --drive <url>` or `reticle verify`, which launch an autonomous browser for unattended automation.

To attach to a browser the user already has open (zero download, zero extra process):

```bash
# Start Chrome with remote debugging enabled (user does this once):
# Mac: /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
# Then set RETICLE_CDP_URL when starting the daemon:
RETICLE_CDP_URL=http://localhost:9222 npx @reticlehq/server mcp
```

### "Failed to reconnect to reticle: -32000"

This means the `reticle mcp` proxy process exited and Claude Code couldn't restart it cleanly. -32000 is the JSON-RPC code for a server-side error; here it means the proxy exited with code 1 before the MCP handshake completed.

**Check version first — stale npx cache is the most common silent culprit.** `npx` caches packages locally and may keep running an old version of `@reticlehq/server` even after a new one is published. An older daemon speaking a different protocol than the new proxy (or vice-versa) causes the proxy to exit immediately and Claude Code to report -32000. Always clear the cache and force-resolve the latest version before investigating anything else:

```bash
npx --yes @reticlehq/server@latest version   # force-resolves latest and prints version
npx @reticlehq/server stop                    # stop any daemon running the old version
```

Then reload Claude Code (`/mcp`) so the new version is picked up on next connection.

**Second common cause: the Stop hook is killing the daemon between turns.** If `~/.claude/settings.json` has a Stop hook running `reticle stop --quiet`, remove it. The daemon must stay alive across turns — killing it forces a cold-boot spawn on every reconnect, and if that spawn takes longer than 10 seconds (cold npx cache, slow disk, first install), the proxy times out and exits with code 1. See Step 1b above.

**Fix (in order):**

1. **Force the latest version and clear the stale daemon:**

   ```bash
   npx --yes @reticlehq/server@latest version
   npx @reticlehq/server stop
   ```

   Reload Claude Code. If -32000 is gone, done.

2. **Check for the Stop hook:** `cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep reticle` If present, delete that hook entry, then repeat step 1.

3. **If -32000 persists**, the daemon may be crashing on startup. Check the log: `cat ~/.reticle/daemon-4400.log | tail -30` Look for `reticle_daemon_start_failed` or `reticle_mcp_proxy_error`. If the port is taken by another process: `lsof -i :4400` to identify it, then kill it and retry.

4. **Confirm the MCP config is user-level** (not project-level) and has no pinned version:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.claude/claude_mcp_config.json
   # Should contain: {"mcpServers": {"reticle": {"command": "npx", "args": ["@reticlehq/server", "mcp"]}}}
   ```

   If the project has a `.mcp.json` or `.claude/mcp.json` that overrides the user-level config with pinned args (e.g., `["@reticlehq/server@0.x.y", "mcp"]`), rename it out of the way and re-register:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add reticle -s user -- npx @reticlehq/server mcp
   ```

**Tell the user what you found** so they can confirm which fix applies.
